#  Mixed Interaction Conditional Gaussian Model for hair chemical analysis

`R` code for a study aimed the estimation and evaluation of a Mixed Interaction (MI) Conditional Gaussian (CG) graphical model with purpose of verifying whether it is possible to discriminate, people coming from volcanic geological areas and those coming from areas made up of sedimentary rocks, through the chemical elements collected. Such hypothesis verification would reinforce the idea that chemical analyzes on hair could lead to identifying areas of environmental risk.
